# Cron Metrics Collector & Exporter (Go Edition)

## Overview

A Go-based API and web server to centralize cron job results and export their statuses as Prometheus-compatible metrics. Focused on simple curl integration, fast and robust deployment, complete lifecycle management (CRUD API), and sophisticated monitoring—including maintenance/alert suppression and structured, maintainable code and docs.

## Key Features

- Central REST API for job result submissions (/api/job-result/) and full CRUD management of jobs
- Prometheus /metrics endpoint displaying per-job status, totals, and label-rich job metrics
- Per-job automatic failure threshold (auto-marks jobs as failed if silence exceeds threshold)
- Arbitrary user-defined labels per job for flexible Prometheus queries and UI filtering
- Maintenance mode: jobs can be paused to suppress alerting/downtime without removal
- Admin CLI for all job management operations
- Strictly versioned configuration and code, reproducible builds, and up-to-date docs

## Functional Requirements

- Job Management:
  - CRUD operations for job definitions via API and CLI:
    - Create: Register new job (name, host, threshold, labels, status)
    - Read: List/filter all jobs
    - Update: Modify thresholds, labels, maintenance flag
    - Delete: Remove job definition
  - Job status/lifecycle flags (active, maintenance, paused, retired), adjustable at runtime via API/CLI
  - Maintenance/paused jobs are excluded from alerting in /metrics, and clearly flagged in all outputs
- Metrics and Monitoring:
  - /metrics endpoint outputs Prometheus-formatted metrics:
    - Per-job status (cronjob_status), last run, last error, auto-failure reason/expiry, all labels
    - Jobs in maintenance/status have value -1 or a dedicated status="maintenance" label
  - Automatic failure if no result within automatic_failure_threshold (per job)
  - Metrics include all user-supplied labels
- Security:
  - Two-tier authentication system for enhanced security isolation
  - Admin API keys for job management operations (CRUD endpoints)
  - Per-job API keys for result submissions (unique key per job)
  - Automatic API key generation with secure random data and validation
  - Job isolation: each job can only submit results for itself
  - All endpoints over HTTPS in production
- Data Retention:
  - Configurable retention above default (e.g., 30 or 90 days)
  - Option to purge logs, redact sensitive “output” fields
- Admin Tooling & Dashboard:
  - Cobra CLI commands for serve, job CRUD, config management
  - Simple API-driven UI/dashboard for browsing/filtering jobs and statuses (optional in MVP)

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Containerized build (Docker), static Linux binary, comprehensive GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- <300 ms /metrics for up to 10,000 jobs
- Pure Go codebase, Viper config (YAML + env overrides), structured logging (Zap or Logrus)
- Documentation always up-to-date as source of project truth

## API/Job Structure

### Job Definition Example

```json
{
  "id": 42,
  "job_name": "db_import",
  "host": "backup3",
  "api_key": "cm_abcd1234567890abcdef123456789abcdef123456789abcd",
  "automatic_failure_threshold": 3600,
  "labels": {
    "env": "stage",
    "team": "migration"
  },
  "status": "maintenance"
}
```

### JobResult Submission Example

```bash
# Using job-specific API key for result submission
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/job-result \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: cm_abc123456789abcdef123456789abcdef123456789abcd" \
  -d '{
    "job_name": "sync_db",
    "host": "web1",
    "status": "success",
    "labels": {
      "env": "prod",
      "team": "infra",
      "type": "backup"
    },
    "duration": 27,
    "timestamp": "2025-10-30T19:56:00Z"
  }'
```

**Security Note**: Each job can only submit results for itself. The API validates that the job name and host in the request match the job associated with the provided API key.

### Prometheus Metrics Example

```text
# HELP cronjob_status Status of cron job: 1=success, 0=failure, -1=maintenance/paused
# TYPE cronjob_status gauge

# Active job with successful result
cronjob_status{job_name="sync_db",host="web1",env="prod",team="infra",status="success"} 1

# Active job with failed result
cronjob_status{job_name="backup",host="web2",env="prod",status="failure"} 0

# Job that missed its deadline (auto-failed)
cronjob_status{job_name="cleanup",host="web3",env="prod",status="missed_deadline"} 0

# Maintenance mode job (no alerting)
cronjob_status{job_name="db_import",host="backup3",env="stage",status="maintenance"} -1

# HELP cronjob_last_run_timestamp Timestamp of last job execution
# TYPE cronjob_last_run_timestamp gauge
cronjob_last_run_timestamp{job_name="sync_db",host="web1"} 1698758400

# HELP cronjob_total Total number of registered cron jobs
# TYPE cronjob_total gauge
cronjob_total 4
```

**Key Metrics Features:**

- **Status Labels**: All metrics include `status` labels for precise alerting
- **User Labels**: Custom job labels are automatically included in metrics
- **Automatic Failure Detection**: Jobs exceeding thresholds get `status="missed_deadline"`
- **Maintenance Support**: Maintenance jobs get `status="maintenance"` and value `-1` for alert suppression

### Authentication System

The system implements a two-tier authentication model:

#### Admin API Keys

- **Purpose**: Job management operations (CRUD)
- **Configuration**: `CRONMETRICS_SECURITY_ADMIN_API_KEYS` environment variable
- **Usage**: Required for all job management endpoints
- **Header**: `Authorization: Bearer <admin-api-key>`

#### Per-Job API Keys

- **Purpose**: Job result submissions (isolated per job)
- **Generation**: Automatically generated when creating jobs (or custom via `--api-key`)
- **Format**: `cm_` prefix + base32-encoded random data (52 chars)
- **Usage**: Each job uses its own unique key for result submissions
- **Header**: `X-API-Key: <job-specific-api-key>`
- **Security**: Jobs can only submit results for themselves

### OpenAPI (Swagger) API

Complete API documentation is available through multiple formats:

- **Interactive Documentation**: Swagger UI at `/swagger/` endpoint
- **Machine-readable Spec**: OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification at `/api/openapi.yaml`

### Tooling & Codebase

- Cobra: CLI structure (cmd/cronmetrics for serve, job, config, etc.)
- Viper: Unified config loader (YAML + env), reloadable at runtime
- Logrus/Zap: Structured logging
- mise: Build/test/env standardization, managed with .tool-versions
- Project Layout:

```text
/cmd/cronmetrics
/pkg/api
/pkg/metrics
/pkg/config
/pkg/model
/pkg/log
/internal/cli
/docs/
.tool-versions
.env
```

### CLI Example

```bash
# Server management
cronmetrics serve --config /etc/cronmetrics/config.yaml

# Job management with API key generation
cronmetrics job add --name backup --host db1 --threshold 600 --label env=prod
# Output: Job ID 1 ('backup@db1') created successfully
#         API Key: cm_abc123456789abcdef123456789abcdef123456789abcd
#         NOTE: Save this API key for your cron jobs to submit results.
#         You can retrieve it later using: cronmetrics job show 1

# Job management with custom API key
cronmetrics job add --name backup2 --host db1 --api-key cm_custom-key --threshold 600

# Update job settings (using job ID)
cronmetrics job update 1 --maintenance
cronmetrics job update 1 --api-key cm_new-rotated-key
cronmetrics job update 2 --name backup2-renamed --host db2  # Can update name/host via ID

# List jobs with API key visibility
cronmetrics job list --label env=prod
cronmetrics job list --show-api-keys  # Shows masked keys for security
cronmetrics job show 1  # Shows full API key and job details
```

### Logging Conventions

- Structured logging (Zap or Logrus), key-value pairs
- Context: Always log job, host, user, request_id, and error/return where relevant
- Log Levels:
  - DEBUG: Function entry/exit with params/returns (when enabled)
  - INFO: System lifecycle, submission/crud events
  - WARNING: Recoverable issues (invalid config, submission rejections)
  - ERROR: Critical errors, panics, data loss risks
- Log in UTC, RFC3339 timestamps, always thread safe

### Documentation & Maintainability

- `/docs/` directory contains API spec (OpenAPI), admin/usage/config guides, changelog
- All PRs and code changes must update docs
- Linting and doc-completeness checks in CI
- README, CONTRIBUTING, and onboarding step-by-step for devs
